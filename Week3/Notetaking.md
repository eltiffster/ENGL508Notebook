From [Jentery's notes for week 3](http://jentery.github.io/508/notes):

If you are looking for ways to read scholarly articles and publications, then I recommend [Boyle's "...Something Like a Reading Ethics,"](http://caseyboyle.net/2016/01/16/something-like-a-reading-ethics/) especially the "Ethical Reading" section, which Boyle summarizes like so:

**Steps for faster and productive reading**

**Overview**

* Skim through the work noting the title, chapter, subtitles, indices, etc.
* Read the introduction & conclusion
* Fill in the rest by reading through the work

**Engagement**

* *Exigence* (identify the writer's articulation of the exigence)
* *Response* (identify what the writer is bringing in response to exigence).
* *Key Terms/Words* (locate the key terms and concepts)
* *Key Citations* (3-4 key citations the work relies on)
* *Questions* (understanding and critique)
* *Speculative Response* (speculate how a writer might respond to Questions in Step 5). (See Boyle 2016: n. pag.)
