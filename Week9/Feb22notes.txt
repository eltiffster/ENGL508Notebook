NYU is where all the media history ppl are

The Blank
-Gitelman: as a pop culture phenomenon
	-not meant to be read
-Add blanks to it (like mad libs?)
-Gitelman, *Paper Knowledge
-blanks make bureacracy

**Ask Jentery for his article on prototyping, analytical bibliography -- especially for Directed Reading

-studying with book as physical object very close to prototyping

-the long history of forgery: duplication with the intent to deceive, dupe

*Forgers and Critics, Anthony Grafton 1990
-"the images easily fool the eye but not the hand"

Thomas Wise
-they weren't copies, but persuasive originals in a way
-**"books which ought to have existed but didn't"**
	-social justice? Knowingly ignored, obfuscated, or destroyed
-forgery as counterpoint to authenticity (without being just "fake")

Sterne
-arguing against histories of "interiorities"
	-you cannot inhabit the world as someone else did

Exploratory or experimental [?]
-you are not closer to real history. THERE IS NO REAL HISTORYYYYYY

Prototyping doesn't end with identifying gaps (problematizing)
-to enact an alternative model or a response
-to attest or experiment with them

The beginning of the OED
Design-in-use: resources for further creative action
-using back of chair as coat rack, sofa cushion as table
-stresses affordances of objects: new, different, and unintended functions
-to what degree does this invite people to reengineer/modify them

GLAM
-looting or plundering culture instead of restoring it?

-prototyping: "creative restoration"

-intervention must be distinct, but yet still somewhat harmonious? Unified?
	-looks at first blush like the original, BUT IS NOT

-----------------

The idea of a forgery
-not flagrant, but convincing (deliberately)
-disruptions or alterations
