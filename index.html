<p>Between the 1870s and 1970s, what are some notable -isms operating across art, culture, and politics? How were these -isms designed?</p>

<p>Take notes on your general impressions of at least five -isms. Please attend to the politics and aesthetics of each -ism, with notes on the historical particulars of when each occurred and why.</p>

<p>Wyndham Lewis, Ezra Pound, other signatories of the manifesto</p>

<p><img src="images/vorticism1.jpg" alt="Blast Magazine Cover July 1915"></p>

<p>Manifesto(s?) in <a href="http://library.brown.edu/pdfs/1143209523824858.pdf">BLAST, Review of the Great English Vortex, Number 1</a>, Wyndham Lewis</p>

<h4>
<a id="history" class="anchor" href="#history" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>History</h4>

<ul>
<li>As a movement, was very short-lived: started in 1914 and did not outlast the war</li>
<li>Wyndham Lewis (largely credited as the movement's founder, though he did not coin the term(that was Pound)) tried to revive it as "Group X" but that didn't fly</li>
<li>Perhaps its violence after the war was off-putting?</li>
<li>Supposedly, according to <a href="http://vorticism.co.uk/vpages/introduction/">this</a>, were the first to popularize the magazine-form manifesto</li>
<li>Same source points to democratization of Art as a driving force for its popularity (?)</li>
<li>Britain a major industrial power, esp. British Navy (blessed in the manifesto)</li>
</ul>

<h4>
<a id="politics" class="anchor" href="#politics" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Politics</h4>

<ul>
<li>Sets itself up as a violent break from the past ("BLAST", after all); mentions/disdains/blasts past movements like Aestheticism ("The Britanic Aesthete"(?), "Rousseauism")</li>
<li>Violence as somehow purifying or cleansing: language of disease ("sins and infections" (11); a "lump" that bursts (32))</li>
<li>Same in the figure of the hairdresser attacking Mother Nature, trimming hair into "<em>clean</em> arched shapes and angular plots" (emphasis mine)

<ul>
<li>In that way, seems to be bringing order to disorder, but paradoxically the form of the piece is disordered</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Trying to be democratizing? For "everyone"; but also for "no man"? Denying/rejecting a specific audience?</li>
<li>Is it about inhabiting extreme perspectives or neither? Do the two annihilate each other or something?</li>
<li>Gender politics: kind of stereotypically "macho" masculine, "blasts" things for being "effeminate" and weak, "disease of femininity" (15)</li>
<li>Heavy nationalist bent: England vs. France, the pride of the English Navy</li>
<li>Rejects sentimentality, excess (e.g. the excess of aestheticism)</li>
</ul>

<h4>
<a id="aesthetics" class="anchor" href="#aesthetics" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Aesthetics</h4>

<ul>
<li>Typeface: <a href="http://www.typorn.org/article/how-blast-magazine-has-changed-literature">Grotesque No. 9</a> by Blake Stephenson (British type designer)</li>
<li>Significance of an ordered/hierarchical list?</li>
<li>What to make of the symbol?</li>
<li>blockish, square type suggests force, stability</li>
<li>In some ways, seems very orderly (hierarchical, ordered list, straight forceful lines); but in others, seems chaotic (e.g. random lists of images/symbols/institutions, the 3 on one page isn't centered like the rest)</li>
</ul>

<p>Kiyonori Kikutake, Kisho Kurokawa and Fumihiko Maki</p>

<p><img src="images/metabolism1.jpg" alt="Marine City"></p>

<ul>
<li>
<em>Shintinchaisa</em>(新陳代謝) means "metabolism" in a scientific/biological sense, but can also mean "renewal or regeneration...closely related to the Buddhist concepts of transmogrification and reincarnation" (Wendelken 287)</li>
<li>Architectural movement, although Metabolism's proponents did write extensively on it</li>
<li>Key Text would be <em>Metabolism 1960—Proposals for a New Urbanism</em> (Can't find an original copy, only excerpts in various secondary sources)

<ul>
<li>Prepared for the 1960 Tokyo World Design Conference</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>

<h4>
<a id="history-1" class="anchor" href="#history-1" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>History</h4>

<ul>
<li>Post-WWII era: reaction to devastation after the war (fire-bombing in Tokyo, twin bombs over Hiroshima and Nagasake) and the constant threat of nuclear warfare</li>
<li>Emphasis on rebuilding, recovering after the war: metabolists saw themselves as designers of prostheses (293) creating "cyborg architecture" (?25)</li>
<li>Scientific advances in biology (e.g. discovery of DNA)</li>
<li>After the war, foreign occupation and reconstruction led Japanese architects to want to assert their own identity/aesthetic</li>
</ul>

<p><img src="images/metabolism4.jpg" alt="Tokyo after bombing"></p>

<h4>
<a id="politics-1" class="anchor" href="#politics-1" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Politics</h4>

<ul>
<li>As a nationalist project: wanting to assert tradition (somewhat) independent of foreign (esp. American) influence, "an -ism that rivalled Western avant-garde"</li>
<li>Metabolists may also have been anxious about the survival of their culture, both in reference to the war's destruction as well as foreign influences on reconstruction</li>
<li>In response to a fear of totalitarian regimes (both that fell/were emerging): emphasized flexibility, organic growth, modularity over/against political rigidity and restraint

<ul>
<li>Is anything ever really "organic" rather than socially determined? Significance of modularity?</li>
<li>as part of "organic growth", old parts/capsules were supposed to be replaced by new ones -- what is role of waste and obsolescence?</li>
<li>in response to (Western) criticism of disposability, Kurokawa emphasizes "replacement" or regeneration common in Eastern philosophies (31-2)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Is spiritual, draws upon (Shinto?) Buddhist ideas of impermanence, regeneration

<ul>
<li>as a (materially-speaking) "new" Japan built over top of the old one while essentially keeping the same spirit</li>
<li>emphasis on interconnectedness</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Perhaps despite its creators' intentions, and especially as its influence spread beyond Japan, metabolism was criticized for encouraging/enabling the Western capitalist/consumerist attitude it tried to set aside

<ul>
<li>accused of encouraging "overworked, isolated male drone" mentality (296)</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>

<h4>
<a id="aesthetics-1" class="anchor" href="#aesthetics-1" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Aesthetics</h4>

<ul>
<li>Supposedly rejecting visual references to (recent) past Japanese architectural traditions because they are supposedly "unpleasant[ly] naturalist—even militaristic" (289); source is vague about how they actually did this though</li>
<li>use of curves more organic</li>
<li>modular capsules

<ul>
<li>"the ideal contemplative dwelling"—in a Buddhist way? (294)</li>
<li>assertion of individuality (within the collective?), owner can restyle the capsule however she likes</li>
<li>influenced by continuous threat of nuclear annihilation, a protective shell like a bunker (remains untouched inside while the outside has gone to shit)</li>
<li>as "cyborg architecture" or hybrid of human/machine(?): the machine (capsule) and life rely on each other (25)</li>
</ul>
</li>

<h4>
<a id="history-3" class="anchor" href="#history-3" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>History</h4>

<ul>
<li>Britain growing industrial power, child labour, poor working conditions, other Dickensian business, national pride etc. etc.</li>
<li>Wealth inequalities persisted, but weren't quite so stratified as they used to be (rising middle class, "white collar" jobs)</li>
<li>Following Marx, saw industrial working conditions of the time as exploitative, dehumanizing and wanted to set itself apart from that</li>
<li>Influence of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Ruskin">John Ruskin</a> (esp. <em>Modern Painters</em>): craftsmen/labourers should be involved in all aspects/stages of production, from design to execution, promoted "enobling work"</li>
<li>Separation of the spheres (idea also largely attributed to Ruskin) &amp; division of labour: women = hearth &amp; home, men = public sphere; but also growing suffrage &amp; women's rights movements at turn of century</li>
</ul>

<h4>
<a id="politics-3" class="anchor" href="#politics-3" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Politics</h4>

<ul>
<li>Emphasized the rights of the producer/worker, community practice (e.g. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Art_Workers_Guild">Art Workers Guild</a>, informal and, eventually, more formal education)</li>
<li>Though it purported to be democratizing ("Good Taste for All!"), the things the Arts &amp; Crafts made were too expensive (<em>because</em> of the craftsmanship) for anyone but the upper and upper-middle classes to buy
*Was not (perhaps could never hope to be) wholly independent of industrial capital: often relied on patronage/investment from upper-MC/factory owners for start-up costs or to produce their works</li>
<li>(sometimes in theory, though not always in practice) privileged the handmade over machine-made
*for some Arts and Crafts proponents, it was less against machines in general and more about the alienation/labour conditions that arose around them</li>
<li>In our present day, is our own fascination with the Arts and Crafts movement a nostalgia for pre-digital times? Funny, because shows that even nostalgia is never new (pre-industrial or pre-digital)</li>
<li>Arts and Crafts, as a movement, spread not only to other parts of the Western world (Ireland, America, Europe, etc) but also to India, China, etc. (far less talked about for obvi reasons), so might think of "which Arts and Crafts" as much broader than is usually talked about</li>
<li>Gender:

<ul>
<li>Many women worked in the A&amp;C movement, though there was a separation/divison of labour/craftsmanship within A&amp;C: women exclusively did embroidery, lace-making, etc. while men did all the silversmithing, glass-making, etc.</li>
<li>Women were not allowed in the Art Workers Guild &gt;:(, but created their own Women's Guild of Arts, though Callen argues that it came too late (1907) in the Movement to have much of an impact within the broader A&amp;C</li>
<li>In this way, reinforces traditional divisions of labour rather than being progressive, but the "rising profile of female craft industries" cannot be separated from proactive efforts/campaigning by women for increased access to political, educational, and labour institutions</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>

<h4>
<a id="aesthetics-3" class="anchor" href="#aesthetics-3" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Aesthetics</h4>

<ul>
<li>Emphasis on "nature", both as a thematic aspect as well as in the sense of "natural" or "organic" materials and appearances (e.g. not painting over/otherwise disguising one material as another)</li>
<li>Medievalist aesthetic might be a sort of nostalgia over the pre-industrial</li>

<ul>
<li>extends beyond Western tradition (Enlightenment) Islamic philosophy in the Middle East (see Ben-Zaken)</li>
<li>19th-century: emphasis on self-improvement or refining "taste" (a la Smiles' <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Samuel_Smiles#Self-Help"><em>Self-Help</em></a> or <em>Great Expectations</em>) the middle-class, mutual improvement societies, women scholars, education &amp; slavery</li>
<li>Early to mid 20th-century: "rags to riches," the Horatio Alger myth</li>
<li>In more modern times: explosion in mid-century of self-help books, glorification of the "self-made" innovator or entrepeneur (middle-class white male, think Bill Gates or Steve Jobs), "From Zero to Maker"</li>

<a id="politics-4" class="anchor" href="#politics-4" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Politics</h4>

<ul>
<li>On the one hand, seems to be explicitly political or subversive if you take the long history of class struggle, women and people of colour autodidacts who circumvent formal structures of education made to exclude them</li>
<li>On the other hand, seems to reinforce institutional privileges that already exist:

<ul>
<li>relies heavily on leisure time for "added labour" (see <em>Self-Help Inc.</em>), access to resources/knowledge to "teach yourself," environments that encourage and foster learning</li>
<li>at times, can be rather individualistic, essentialist, rely on narratives of the singular genius</li>
<li>How subversive or radical is it? Still succeeding within the same capitalist system or do you change the system from within?</li>

<ul>
<li>Not too sure about this one, especially since I haven't chosen a text yet</li>
<li>For most self-help texts, common move is to reference a parable and then extract/expound upon some nugget of wisdom</li>
<li>explicitly didactic (expected to be), often giving instructions in the imperative and repeating them throughout, a "catchy" phrase

<ul>
<li>would assume a certain kind of audience? Class, gender, race, etc.?</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Considering <em>Lifemanship</em>, which is a parody of self-help books</li>
