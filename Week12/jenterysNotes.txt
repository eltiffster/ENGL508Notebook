* For the bot (your capstone project), it might be really interesting to work your way through what it means to treat either Carnegie as an object of artificial intelligence (e.g., is the aim to make a bot that resembles his writing?) or autodidacticism as an -ism conducive to automation (perhaps published on Twitter, too). Is there some connection here with practices such as lifehacking? Or with Make magazine or Instructables? On Monday, I was left wanting to hear more about why a bot for autodidacticism in the first place. Know what I mean? What makes either interesting? And why are they interesting together?
* To increase the stakes or implications of your work, you may want to articulate what exactly bots or Python scripts tell us out autodidacticism. For instance, how would you communicate your work to a scholar of mid-20th-century American culture who doesn't work with bots or computation?
* In terms of present-day relevance, I was struck by the ways in which you positioned the bot as a counterfactual, and I was curious about the particulars there. Would the counterfactual element be the existence of bots during the 1930s? If so, then this may interest: http://blogs.evergreen.edu/cpat/files/2013/05/Computer-Power-and-Human-Reason.pdf. Weizenbaum wrote ELIZA (about 30 years after Carnegie's book, but still relevant in many ways). How is Carnegie's work (you mentioned rhetoric, in particular) appropriate for natural language processing? In short, how would you respond to claims that "everyone's just making bots now"? Why THIS bot?
* Based on your presentation on Monday, I assume your "____ It" is "Make It a Bot." Does that sound right? What would instructions for the exercise look like? Why would this exercise be especially important for autodidacticism? How is it at once creative and critical? Or how does it combine scholarly distance with scholarly immersion?
