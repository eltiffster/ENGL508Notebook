Criticism: redaction and glitch at the level of technique

The Portfolio
* Foreground the -ism, not digital studies
* Meant to evoke specific behaviour/interaction
* Conceptual thread can be a persistent question that changes over time
* "Further Reading" section

Don't need author's statement on 4th
Author's statement: top shelf

(Manifesto and Prototype as) Action Writing
-not fiction
-performative utterances: they call something into being by writing it
-claim (to innnovation)
-in the present (opposes the past, poised for the future)
-feels immediate
-prompt behaviour
-forward
-calling for fulfillment (please!)
-does what it says

Diff meanings of prototypes
-"an archetype or exemplar"
-in 19th century, was an imitation
-trying to imitate or rehearse
-also becomes a verb
-a catalyst
-inhabit
-experimentation or immanent critique: you are always implicated in what you critique
-suggestion of lack: the prototype is deficient (assumption)
-iteration

What's the relationship between writing and prototype?

What are you doing when you prototype as writing?
-experimenting or enacting a (critical) method
-"I'm an -ist who -izes"
-an expression of form that prompts a behaviour in a certain context
-criticize by improving, or highlighting by ruining
-articulate or entangle language, meaning and matter
-measured or interpreted based on effectiveness of experiment (as opposed to the final result)
-confronting, disrupting convention and bias
-change primary source

Recall Samuels and McGann
-specifically the motivations
-"operating system of language"
-systems in which meaning is produced
-perceptual and aesthetic biases of a text
-"the secondary status of interpretation"
-suspicion of meaning within text, meaning is "a residue"
-Y u no like deformance?
	-seems like form is supposed to reside in the text even when meaning doesn't
	-predicated on loss rather than change
-link between isolation and redaction?
	-redaction announces itself whereas the white space may not
	-the white space could be confused as part of form
	-when is it an assertion of absence?
	-it would be problematic to use "redaction" without addressing the politics of that
The role of surprise
	-we cannot predict results
	-Menkman: glitch as non-communication

Glitch gets at the desire for a source, playin on that anxiety

Does it depend on intent? On subjectivity?

You're never supposed to redact the original, only copies

Is Holzer complicit in the same bureaucratic violence she supposedly is criticizing?
	-by aestheticizing politics
	-does this let you get closer to the text or farther away?

Redaction suggests intent
-both in writing but also in choosing what to redact
-foreground structural conditions in which writing takes place
-words become formalisms

Glitch and redaction playing with violence at the level of aesthetics

Lack of coherence frustrates us, where is the symbolic?

The idea of integration
-glitch can be the result of downsampling, compression and reduction
-cybernetic image: compare glitched to source
-glitches are not failures, but integrated into systems
	-"systems thinking" that isn't addressed elsewhere

Diff b/t failure and glitch?
-"failure" is defined socially whereas "glitch" is about both people and machines

You need a compiler to do a glitch. Must have input/output, something that goes awry

Glitch requires a lack of agency, critiquing Romantic notion of expressive creativity and intent
	failure operating at a systems level instead of an individual level
	gets at control fetish, but can also itself be fetishized (*Tara Rodgers, Pink Noises)

Phil on translation: assuming foundational "meaning" that can be translated
